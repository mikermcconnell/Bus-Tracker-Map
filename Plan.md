# Mini Map Feature Plan

**Overall Progress:** `100%`

## Tasks:

- [x] ğŸŸ© **Step 1: Layout scaffolding**
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Add inset map container in `index.html` and apply base styles (â‰ˆ20% screen, bottom-left)
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Implement responsive rules to collapse/disable inset on tight viewports

- [x] ğŸŸ© **Step 2: Secondary map initialization**
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Create Leaflet mini-map instance with static terminal-focused view and decorative border
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Share tile configuration and legend visibility hooks with main map context

- [x] ğŸŸ© **Step 3: Vehicle rendering pipeline**
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Extend vehicle updates to mirror live vehicles on the inset without clustering
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Respect route visibility toggles while filtering to terminal vicinity only

- [x] ğŸŸ© **Step 4: Terminal highlighting linkage**
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Draw matching border/overlay on main map around the terminal to visually pair with the inset
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Ensure both borders respond to layout collapse states

- [x] ğŸŸ© **Step 5: Validation**
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Smoke-test desktop and mobile layouts
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Verify legend toggles, vehicle updates, and responsive collapse behave as expected
