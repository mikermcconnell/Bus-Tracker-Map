Snapshot captured after revamping stop highlights, vehicle clustering, and development tooling.

- Repository now organized under `frontend/src/` with modular controllers (`map/controller.js`, `ui/controller.js`, `data/client.js`) bundled by `scripts/build-frontend.js`; legacy `frontend/app.js`, `index.html`, and `styles.css` were removed in favour of hashed dist assets.
- Live vehicle markers cluster within 400 m, rendering combined pills that float above single-route icons while popups list every bus (`frontend/src/map/controller.js`, `frontend/src/map/vehicle-groups.js`, `frontend/src/styles.css`).
- Highlighted stops display short-form labels (e.g., GM, GC, BATT) with a left-side “Transit Hubs” legend describing each abbreviation (`frontend/src/map/controller.js`, `frontend/src/ui/controller.js`, `frontend/src/index.html`, `frontend/src/styles.css`).
- Development workflow features hot reload via `npm run dev`, powered by `scripts/watch-frontend.js` and `scripts/dev.js`; README documents the new commands and layout.
- Tests expanded with `tests/vehicle-groups.test.js` ensuring clustering behaviour, and all Vitest suites pass (`npm test`).
