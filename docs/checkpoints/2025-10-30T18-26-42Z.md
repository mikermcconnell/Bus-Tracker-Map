# Checkpoint â€” 2025-10-30T18:26:42Z

This snapshot captures the repository state before the post-review remediation plan is implemented.

- Plan tracking (`Plan.md`) lists all remediation tasks as incomplete.
- Frontend assets live in `frontend/` with a single `app.js` that contains map setup, data fetching, and UI handling in one file.
- Static files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`) are referenced directly without hashing or a build pipeline.
- Express server (`server/server.js`) serves the frontend from `frontend/` and exposes `/api/routes.geojson`, `/api/stops.geojson`, and `/api/vehicles.json` with permissive CORS (`cors()`).
- GTFS build script (`scripts/build-geojson.js`) runs independently without automated tests.
- No automated CI workflow or test suite is configured.
