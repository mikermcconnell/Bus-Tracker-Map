# Checkpoint — 2025-10-31T13:36:42Z

Current repository snapshot after implementing stop highlight tweaks and hot-reload tooling.

- Stop highlight styling updates live under `frontend/src/styles.css`, including the resized “You Are Here” note.
- Highlight markers render above all map layers via the raised `stopHighlightPane` z-index (`frontend/src/map/controller.js`).
- Development workflow now supports live rebuilding: `scripts/watch-frontend.js` keeps `frontend/dist/` up to date and `scripts/dev.js` orchestrates the watcher plus Express server with livereload.
- npm scripts were refreshed (`package.json`) and documentation captured in `README.md`; `npm run dev` describes the recommended hot-reload loop.
- Dependencies were regenerated (`package-lock.json`) to incorporate the new watcher tooling (`chokidar`).
